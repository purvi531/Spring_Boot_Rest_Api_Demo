4. In this project, we have used the name of data members(id, name),same as the columns of the Database.
   If I use different names in the data member( e.g: ItemName instead of name ), will I be able to pull the data from Database?
       i. If yes, how?
       i.If no, why ?

ANS: yes,it is completely possible to have different names of the data members and column names of database.
      
      For that we have @column annotation in java.
      @column annotaion a way to set the column names of the database for that particular data member

 

eg:if we have a member variable as 
     @column(name="Student_name")
     private int n;  //this is the name variable

so here the member variable is "n" but when we have column annotaion to it
it specifies that the name of the column for this member variable in database should be "student_name"

if the member variable is not annoted then default column names (same as member variable ) is set.

so,this @column annotaion is optional and it provides customized mapping between entity and database column
